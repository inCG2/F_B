    <h2>Football Position</h2>

    <p>In the sport of association football, each of the 11 players on a 
        <br> team is assigned to a particular position on the field of play. 
        <br> A team is made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players 
        <br> who fill various defensive, midfield, and attacking positions 
        <br> depending on the formation deployed. These positions describe both the player's 
        <br> main role and their area of operation on the pitch.

    <p>The fluid nature of the modern game means that positions in football are not as rigidly 
        <br> defined as in sports such as rugby or American football. Even so, most players will 
        <br> play in a limited range of positions throughout their career, as each position requires a particular 
        <br> set of skills and physical attributes. Footballers who are able to play comfortably in a number of positions 
        <br> are referred to as "utility players".</p>

    <h2>Football Formation</h2>

    <p>The location of 11 players from each team on the soccer field where they are deployed to perform team tactics. 
    <br>Each team consists of one goalkeeper and 10 outfield players, who are divided into defenders, 
    <br>midfielders and strikers according to the formation.</p>
