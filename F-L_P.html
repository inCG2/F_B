    <h2>Legends Player</h2>

    <p>The players listed in this website are all world class players - the greatest players 
        <br> their position of all time. But only a select few can be counted amongst the 
        <br> much smaller category of 'Legends'. These are the iconic players that are the best 
        <br> the game has ever seen. They have represented the game - becoming household 
        <br> names even to those who do not follow it, they have transformed and expanded 
        <br> the game, and have seized the imagination of the world - often during a World Cup. 
        <br> Most of all they have acted as an inspiration to both fans and amateur and 
        <br> professional players and have inspired millions to follow, play and learn the game.
