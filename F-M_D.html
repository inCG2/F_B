    <h2>Football Derector</h2>

    <p>The role of a director of football 
        <br> is not always clearly defined, but they form a part of the senior management 
        <br> at a club and transfers are usually their chief remit.</p>

    <p>Their responsibilities can vary from club to club, with some being heavily 
        <br> involved in all aspects of the business, including the hiring and firing of managers, 
        <br> scouting, recruitment of players, long-term strategy and the improvement of facilities. 
        <br> In other cases, the role can be slightly more specialised, depending on an individual's particular talents.
    </p>

    <p>Those who take up roles as directors of football usually have a history in the 
        <br> sport and a wide network of contacts, while others simply have a background 
        <br> in similar administrative roles.
